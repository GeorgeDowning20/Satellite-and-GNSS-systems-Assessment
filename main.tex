\section{Part 1}\label{part1}

Design a satellite communication link operating in the Ku band to meet C/N and link margin specifications.


\subsection{Satellite Parameters}\label{Satellite Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Antenna gain 25 dB
    \item Receive system noise temperature 500 K
    \item Transponder saturated output power in Ku band 40 W
    \item Transponder bandwidth 36 MHz
    \item Signals: FM-TV analog signal
    \item Earth station receiver IF noise bandwidth is 27MHz
    \item Minimum C/N overall = 12 dB
    \item Boltzmann’s constant in decibels is k=-228.6dBW/K/Hz
\end{itemize}

\subsection{UPLINK}\label{UPLINK}

\subsubsection{Q:}
UPLINK: Design a transmitting earth station (transmitted antenna gain in dB and earth station transmitted power in W) to provide (C/N) up of 35 dB in a Ku-band transponder. Use an uplink antenna with a diameter of 3m and an aperture efficiency of 65\%. The uplink station is located at -2 dB contour of the satellite footprint. Allow 1.5 dB for clear air atmospheric attenuation and other losses. Path length to satellite is 38 500 km. Assume standard frequency allocation of 14GHz for the uplink in Ku-band.


\subsubsection{A:}

Antenna: 3m at 65\% aperture efficiency
Receive: -2dB contour of satellite footprint
transmitt: C/N of 35db
transmitted power: 1.5dB for clear air atmospheric attenuation and other losses
14Ghz for the uplink in Ku-band
Path length to satellite is 38 500 km

\subsection{DOWNLINK}\label{DOWNLINK}

\subsubsection{Q:}

DOWNLINK: Find the power level of the earth station receiver and the antenna gain at the earth receiver station so that overall carrier to noise ratio is 15 dB. Miscellaneous downlink losses are 0.5dB. Earth station is located at -2dB contour of satellite transmitting antenna. The earth station receiver has the following noise temperatures: noise temperature of the input signal is 25K, noise temperature of the RF amplifier is 400K, noise temperature of the mixer is 450 K and the noise temperature of the IFamplifier is 550K. The gain of the RF amplifier is 35 dB, the gain of the mixer is 0dB and the gain of the IF amplifier is 20dB. Assume standard frequency allocation of 11GHz for the downlink in Ku-band.

\subsubsection{A:}

Ku down = 11Ghz
